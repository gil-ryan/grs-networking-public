# Lesson 6: Route Aggregation

## Route Aggregation - The AS_SET Attribute

* Potential problems with aggregation
* The AS_SET attribute

## Potential Problems with Aggregation

* Aggregation reduces route information
    + Best Path to destination might not be chosen from multiple aggregate routes
* Potential misconfiguration
    + Could result in misrouted packets
    + Ensure that aggregate correctly represents aggregated prefixes
* Potential for inter-AS loops
    + AS_PATH SET prevents this

## The AS_PATH SET attribute

* AS_PATH is normally an ordered sequence of AS numbers
    + AS_PATH SEQUENCE
* AS_SET is an unordered sequence of AS numbers
    + Includes all AS numbers of all prefixes belonging to aggregate
    + Same loop prevention rules as AS_PATH SEQUENCE
        - Drop received routes that include local AS number
    + Prevents looping to constituent AS behind aggergation point

```R5 BGP CONFIGS
