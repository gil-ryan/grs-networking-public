## Basic BGP Policy Concepts

* BGP Attributes
    + Routing policy basics
    + Overview of all BGP path attributes

## Routing Policy Basics

* Route advertisements are a "promise" to deliver packets to the advertised prefixes
    + Outgoing advertisements affect incoming traffic
    + Incoming advertisements affect outgoing traffic

* Routing policies change the characteristics of advertised routes
    + And therefore effect traffic flowing in the opposite direction
* BGP path attributes:
    - Are a set of characteristics linked to NLRI that can be added or changed 
    - Influence the BGP decision process for selecting best paths

## BGP Path Attribute Classification

Two classes of attributes, each with two sub-classes:

1. Well-Known:
    * All BGP implementations must understand this attribute
        +  Well-Known Mandatory:
            - An NLRI __must__ have this attribute
        + Well-Known Discretionary:
            - An NLRI might or might not have this attribute
2. Optional:
    * A BGP implementation might or might not understand this attribute
        + Optional Transitive:
            - This attribute is accepted and passed along with the NLRI even if it is not  understood (transitive bit is set)
        + Optional Non-Transitive:
            - If the attribute is not supported it is quietly discarded
