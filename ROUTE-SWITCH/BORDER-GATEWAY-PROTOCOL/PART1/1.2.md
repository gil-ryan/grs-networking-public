# Basic BGP Concepts

From here you can [return to the previous lesson](./1.1.md) or return to the [table of contents](../README.md).

## 1.2 - Inter-Domain Routing

* Types of AS
* Inter-AS multi-homing
* BGP AS_PATH attribute

## Types of AS

An autonomous system can be:

* Single-home
    + one link to an external peer
* Multi-homed
    + multiple links to one or more external peers

## Single-Homed

!(Single-Homed Example)(../../../img/single-homed.png)

* only one connection to an external peer
* no need for incoming BGP here
    + no choices about external routes
    + there is no decisions to be made because there's only a single path for the router to take
* outgoing BGP might be used
    + to advertise internal prefixes to external peer
    + alternative: external peer uses static routes to AS 1 prefixes

## Multi-Homed AS'
