## Injecting Aggregate Routes

* Methods for injecting aggregate routes into BGP
* __ATOMIC_AGGREGATE__ and __AGGREGATOR__ attributes

## Why Aggregate

![Injecting Routing Prefix](../../../img/bgp-route-aggregation.png)

* Reduces the size of BGP updates
    + contributes to network resource conservation
* reduces the size of the BGP tables
    + contributes to overall internet scalability
* "hides" individual prefix instabilities
    + contributes to overall internet stability

## How to Inject Aggregate Routes with BGP

* Method 1: Static Route
    + configure a static route for aggregate address
    + always use null interface for next hop
    + inject aggregate into BGP with __network__ statement
    + most commonly used method
* Method 2: __aggregate-address__ statement
