## BGP Messages

__All__ BGP implementations have to support the following four message types:

* Open
* Keepalive
* Update
* Notification

* Route Refresh (not always supported)

### Open Messages

* requests a BGP session open to a neighbor
* sent after TCP session is established
* specifies:
    + Originator's BGP version number
    + local AS number
    + hold time
    + BGP identifier
    + optional parameters

### Keepalive

* periodically sent after BGP session is open (default is 60 seconds in Cisco IOS)

### Update

* Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)
* Path Attributes
* Withdrawn routes

NLRI does the route exchange and specifies path attributes. When a route is withdrawn or no longer useful.

### Notification

* Sent whenever an error is detected 
* BGP sesion is always closed after sending a Notification message

## BGP Neighbor States

* Idle
* Connect
* Active
* OpenSent
* OpenConfirm
* Established

### Idle

* always the initial BGP state
* Errors (notification messages) always cause a change to idle state

### Connect

* waiting for the TCP session to the neighbor to be completed

### Active

* actively trying to establish a TCP session with the neighbor
    + this can be misleading to those new to BGP, it's actually not good!

### OpenSent

* open message has been sent to neighbor, waiting for a replying Open

### OpenConfirm

* replying Open has been received, waitin for Keepalive or Notification

### Established

* session is fully established
* peers can exchange keepalives, updates, and notifications
