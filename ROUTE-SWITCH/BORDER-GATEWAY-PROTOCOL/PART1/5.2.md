# Lesson 5.2 : The routing information databases (RIBs) used by BGP

## Route Exchange over BGP - Injecting Prefixes Continued

* The __NEXT_HOP__ and __ORIGIN__ Attributes
    + Understanding the __NEXT_HOP__ path attribute
    + Understanding the __ORIGIN__ path attribute

## The NEXT_HOP Path Attibute

* Every BGP NLRI must have a NEXT_HOP attribute
* Default rules for NEXT_HOP
    + NEXT_HOP is set to outgoing interface address when advertising to an external neighbor
    + NEXT_HOP is not changed when advertising to internal neighbors
* If NEXT_HOP is unreachable, NLRI is not entered into routing table
* Two means of making NEXT_HOP reachable to internal neighbors:
    + Make external subnet of NEXT_HOP known to IGP
        - IGP passive interface statement; or
        - __*redistribute connected*__ statement
    + Change default behavior
        - Next-hop-self statement

## The next-hop-self statement

* __next-hop-self__ is modern best practice
    + making external subnets reachable can be an IGP scaling and security problem
* __next-hop-self__:
    + Sets NEXT_HOP attribute to outgoing interface address (default); or
    + to address of interface specified in __neighbor update-source__ statement
* NEXT_HOP needs only to be changed at AS edge
    + On prefixes sent to IBGP neigbors

> __neighbor__ _IP-ADDRESS_ __next-hop-self__
