# Lesson 5.2 : The routing information databases (RIBs) used by BGP

## Route Exchange over BGP - Injecting Prefixes Continued

* The __NEXT_HOP__ and __ORIGIN__ Attributes
    + Understanding the __NEXT_HOP__ path attribute
    + Understanding the __ORIGIN__ path attribute

## The __NEXT_HOP__ Path Attibute

* Every BGP NLRI must have a __NEXT_HOP__ attribute
* Default rules for __NEXT_HOP__
    + __NEXT_HOP__ is set to outgoing interface address when advertising to an external neighbor
    + __NEXT_HOP__ is not changed when advertising to internal neighbors
* If __NEXT_HOP__ is unreachable, NLRI is not entered into routing table
* Two means of making __NEXT_HOP__ reachable to internal neighbors:
    + Make external subnet of __NEXT_HOP__ known to IGP
        - IGP passive interface statement; or
        - __*redistribute connected*__ statement
    + Change default behavior
        - Next-hop-self statement

## The next-hop-self statement

* __next-hop-self__ is modern best practice
    + making external subnets reachable can be an IGP scaling and security problem
* __next-hop-self__:
    + Sets __NEXT_HOP__ attribute to outgoing interface address (default); or
    + to address of interface specified in __neighbor update-source__ statement
* __NEXT_HOP__ needs only to be changed at AS edge
    + On prefixes sent to IBGP neigbors

> __neighbor__ _IP-ADDRESS_ __next-hop-self__

## The ORIGIN Path Attribute

* Every BGP NLRI must have an ORIGIN attribute
* Introduced to help with transition from EGP to BGP
    + of little practical use now
    + but can still influence BGP prefix selection
