# Lesson 2: Configuring an EBGP Session

From here you can [return to the previous lesson](./1.2.md) or return to the [table of contents](../README.md).

* 2.1 Basic elements for establishing a simple BGP session between two peers
* 2.2 Understanding "show" commands and BGP session states

## BGP Session Basics

BGP views its neighbors differently than IGPs do.

* BGP sessions are point-to-point
    + so they can be carefully controlled
    + always unicast
    + separate session must be established between any neighbor pair
* BGP sessions run over TCP
    + TCP port 179
    + use of TCP sessions for increased reliability
        - acknowledgement
        - retransmission
        - sequencing

## What is EBGP?

* External BGP
* runs between neighbors in different autonomous systems
* internet BGP (IBGP) covered in next lesson

## Configuring EBGP

1. Start BGP process and sepcify local AS number

> router bgp as-number

2. Specify the neighbor's address and AS number

> neighbor [ip-address] remote-as [as-number]

### Notes

* interface addresses already configured
    + on the same subnet
    + L3 Communication verified with ping
* EBGP assumes neighbor is directly connected
    + default
    + multi-hop EBGP discussed later
