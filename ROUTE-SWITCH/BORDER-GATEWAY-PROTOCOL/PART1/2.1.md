# Lesson 2: Configuring an EBGP Session

From here you can [return to the previous lesson](./1.2.md) or return to the [table of contents](../README.md).

* 2.1 Basic elements for establishing a simple BGP session between two peers
* 2.2 Understanding "show" commands and BGP session states

## BGP Session Basics

BGP views its neighbors differently than IGPs do.

* BGP sessions are point-to-point
    + so they can be carefully controlled
    + always unicast
    + separate session must be established between any neighbor pair
* BGP sessions run over TCP
    + TCP port 179
    + use of TCP sessions for increased reliability
        - acknowledgement
        - retransmission
        - sequencing

## What is EBGP?

* External BGP
* runs between neighbors in different autonomous systems
* internet BGP (IBGP) covered in next lesson

## Configuring EBGP

1. Start BGP process and sepcify local AS number

> router bgp as-number

2. Specify the neighbor's address and AS number

> neighbor [ip-address] remote-as [as-number]

### Notes

* interface addresses already configured
    + on the same subnet
    + L3 Communication verified with ping
* EBGP assumes neighbor is directly connected
    + default
    + multi-hop EBGP discussed later

## Securing the EBGP Session

* all EBGP sessions should be secured!
    + untrusted peers
    + EBGP is a primary target for attackers
* BGP uses MD5 authentication
    + should use a seperate password for every EBGP neighbor

> neighbor _[ip-address]_ password _string_

Sample Configuration:

```
neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 65501
neighbor 192.168.1.1 password TEST
```

Note: if you have an established neighborhsip between routers already, adding a password will not become effective until a hard reset is done.
