# Cisco Data Center Architecture Overview

### Cisco Unified Management

Automation, orchestration, and lifecycle management tools simplify deployment and operation or bare-metal installs. This includes physical(bare-metal) servers, virtual/hypervisor-supported enviroments with a heavy focus on virtual machines, plus private, public, and hybrid clouds. These management options remain focused on a centralized, multi-vendor, multi-interface (GUI, third-party applications) approach.

### Cisco Unified Fabric

High-performance data and storage networking are combined into a single, next-geration chassis that offers simplified deployment that can meet budget needs. A unified fabric also offers high-speed connectivity, high availibility, and increased application performance, while reducing security risks in multi-tenant enviroments.

### Cisco Unified Computing

This highly scalable computing solution integrates servers, flash-memory accelerations, and networking with embedded management and automation to simplify operations for physical, virtual, and cloud workloads.

## Three-Tier Network: Core, Aggregations, and Access

The three-tier approach to design was originally known as Cisco ECNM. This model was often used for campus server and desktop connectivity.
