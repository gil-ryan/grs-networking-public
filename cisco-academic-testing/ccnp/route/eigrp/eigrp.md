# EIGRP Deep Dive

## Features of EIGRP

EIGRP is an advanced distance vector protocol, and combines features of distance vector and link state.

* fast convergence

A router that is running EIGRP maintains routing information that is received from its neighbors in the topology table so that it can quickly adapt to alternate routes.

* partial updates
* sophisticated metric
* VLSM support
* multiple network layer protocol support
* seamless connectivity across data-link protocols
