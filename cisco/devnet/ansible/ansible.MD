# Ansible

## What is Ansible

Ansible is an open source automation platform. It uses an agentless architecture, it's written in YAML, that allows you to describe your automation jobs in an easily readable format.

## Prerequisites

Ansible is an "agent-less" tool so there is no need to install anything onto the Cisco IOS XE device to get started. Ansible Core modules for CISCO IOS and IOS XE devices have been available since release 2.3 so need for anything outside of a base Ansible installation.

Both CLI based and NETCONF based configuration are supported. The Ansible NETCONF implementation changed in the 2.5 release, leveraging the newly introduced NETCONF connection instead of the usual local connection.
