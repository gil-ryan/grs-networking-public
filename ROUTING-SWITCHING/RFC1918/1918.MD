# Private IPv4 addresses

## A chart of subnet ranges

The below links will send you to a template textfile of the entire subnet range, the /16 network is about 1Mb and will likely take a few moments to load based on the speed of your Internet connection.

|RFC1918 name|IP address range|Mask bits|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|24-bit block|[10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.250](https://github.com/gil-ryan/grs-developr-operations/blob/master/NETWORKING/10.0.0.0:24.txt)|8 bits|
|20-bit block|[172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255](https://github.com/gil-ryan/grs-developr-operations/blob/master/NETWORKING/172.16.0.0:20.txt)|12 bits|
|16-bit block|[192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255](https://github.com/gil-ryan/grs-developr-operations/blob/master/NETWORKING/192.168.0.0:16.txt)|16 bits|


## A full detailed list.

A great Python resource is available to print a list of just about any size IP network size. Check out [netaddr](https://github.com/gil-ryan/grs-python-private/blob/master/LIBRARIES/NETADDR/NETADDR.md#layer-3). I also have sample lists created too.
