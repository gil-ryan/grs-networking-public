Usual introduction on why it's useful for everybody.

#### Talking IDE

Selecting VSCode appears to be the top pick for most people. I've discovered it some time ago and selected it before noticing others that are in agreeance. It's light weight and _addon_ ready so you're not overwhelmed, such as Microsoft's full version of Visual Studio, which is daunting to use.

#### Why VSCode

Visual Studio Code is great for support, extentions, themes, and overall flexibility. You can modify your settings in OSX with the __'CMD + ,'__ hotkey. Windows I will add soon.
